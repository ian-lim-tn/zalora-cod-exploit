# ZALORA Cash On Delivery Exploit :money_with_wings:

This python project is created as a case study from a Product Manager's perspective to demonstrate potential exploits when websites such as ZALORA do not employ authentication or verification methods for new users in e-commerce in particular to ZALORA's Cash-On Delivery feature.

This script is intended for [Zalora Malaysia]([https](https://www.zalora.com.my)).

## Disclaimer

Although this repo will be publicly available; its use is **strictly for educational purposes only**. It is mandatory to **cancel any orders that was created by this script**. Individual users of this repo will be held accountable for their own actions.

Failure in cancelling Cash-On Delivery orders will result in potential financial and labour loss to ZALORA and/or ZALORA's third-party logistics(3PL) vendors/ partners such as NinjaVan.


## Dependencies

This script uses a Chrome WebDriver.

You are required to have a Chrome Web Browser. If you do not, download and install [Google Chrome Browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

## Installation

Install [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) package dependencies:

```sh
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

After installation of package dependencies, you are required to make few simple changes to some variable. See _Usage_.

# Usage


## Account creation

You will first need to create a unique account (one that doesn't exist yet).


Go to Credentials in line 19:
```sh
19  ################# CREDENTIALS #################
20
21  # Change first_name string
22  first_name = 'testthis'
23
24  # Change last_name string
25    last_name = 'here'
26
27  # Insert any string
28  town = 'taman tak wujud'
29
30  # Insert any address
31  address = 'jalan tak wujud'

```

Insert or change any string for variable values of:
<ol>
<li>first_name</li>
<li>last_name</li>
</ol>

Optional to insert/ change for variables:
<ol>
<li>town </li>
<li>address </li>
</ol>

#### Note:
Zalora's Cash On Delivery functions only works for certain Postcodes in Malaysia. To avoid the script for breaking, do not make changes to the Postcode variable. Since Zalora does not use any email verification for new users, we can use non-existent emails to register.<br>
<p>
Email is a combination of first_name+last_name@testexploit.com<br>
Password is 123123123 <br>
Use these credentials to login to Zalora as per usual to cancel your scripted order.<br>
</p>
